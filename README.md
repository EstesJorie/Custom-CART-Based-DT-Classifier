# Custom-CART-Based-DT-Classifier
This repo contains work completed in January 2025 as part of my MSc in Data Science. The brief was to create and implement a Custom Decision Tree Classifier, compare the results of it to an implementation of the DecisionTreeClassifier from the SKLearn Python library, and then compare the results within RMarkdown. 

There are two datasets provided in this repo both of which come from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). The first is the Iris dataset which is based on the dataset provided by Fisher (1936). The second dataset is the Secondary Mushroom dataset which provides hypothetical classifications of â‰ˆ61,000 mushrooms.
